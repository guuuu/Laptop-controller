# Laptop-controller

My first app using node.js mixed with some super basic python.

I made this app because I wanted to watch streams on my laptop when i'm in bed, this is a super simple html with some buttons, the text in them is pretty self explanatory.

I basically go to the local IP of my laptop because that's where the node.js/express server is running, and when I click the buttons it run's the python scripts on the laptop.

It's made to iterate mainly with twitch website, even the "go to" button, it's only needed to write the username of the twitch channel.

In case you want to use this, you only need to change the value of the variable "ip" in the index.html and the script.js to the IPv4 of the target computer, then in your phone just open a browser and go to that ip with :8080 in the end.
