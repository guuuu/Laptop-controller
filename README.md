# Laptop-controller

My first app using node.js mixed with some super basic python.

I made this app because I wanted to watch streams on my laptop when i'm in bed, this is a super simple html with some buttons, the text in them is pretty self explanatory.

I basically go to the local IP of my laptop because that's where the node.js/express server is running, and when I click the buttons it run's the python scripts on the laptop.
